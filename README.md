# RMON ‚Äì Raspberry Pi Terminal Monitor

üñ•Ô∏è **RMON** is a terminal-based system monitor for **Raspberry Pi**, inspired by `nmon`, with real-time display of CPU, memory, GPIO states, I2C devices, and more.  
It features a retro ASCII interface with vertical bar charts and section-based color coding.

---

##  Features

- `nmon`-style system monitoring in the terminal (via `curses`)
- Per-core CPU usage and memory load shown with vertical `X` bars
- Real-time status of **GPIO** pins (input mode, ON/OFF)
- **I2C** device detection using `i2cdetect`
- **RaspMesh** detection (checks for `bat0` mesh interface)
- System metrics: CPU temperature, frequency, voltage
- Color-coded sections: CPU, MEM, GPIO, I2C, SYS, etc.
- ASCII `RMON` logo in red, signed "by AAB"

---

##  Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS or similar (tested on Pi 3, 4, 5)
- Python 3.x
- Root privileges (`sudo`)
- Packages:
  - `psutil`
  - `RPi.GPIO`
  - `curses` (built-in)
  - `i2cdetect` from `i2c-tools`

---

##  Installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip i2c-tools
pip3 install psutil RPi.GPIO
```

Clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aranbarri/rmon.git
cd rmon
sudo python3 rmon.py
```

> `sudo` is required to access GPIO and I2C.

## üîç What It Monitors

| Section | Metric                                 |
|--------:|----------------------------------------|
| CPU     | Per-core load with vertical bars       |
| MEM     | RAM usage percentage                   |
| DISK    | Used and free disk space               |
| NET     | Sent/received bytes                    |
| SYS     | CPU temp, frequency, voltage, mesh     |
| I2C     | Devices detected via `i2cdetect`       |
| GPIO    | States of GPIO pins (ON/OFF/N/A/RES)   |

> GPIO pins monitored: BCM 4‚Äì27 (excluding 2 and 3, reserved for I2C)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Want to:

- Monitor only GPIO?
- Add sensors like DHT22, BMP280?
- Export metrics to CSV, InfluxDB, or MQTT?
